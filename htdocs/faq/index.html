    <dt>What is this?</dt>
    <dd>It is a place to share and discover music.</dd>

    <dt>How does it work?</dt>
    <dd>Everyone connected to the site can upload songs to the queue, which is (generally) played in order.  Everybody hears the same song at the same time.</dd>

    <dt>What is my name and how do I change it?</dt>
    <dd>Your name is the yellow one in the members box.  Click it to change.</dd>

    <dt>What does the remove link do?</dt>
    <dd>What you think it does.  It will probably make everyone very angry if you remove songs other than your own.</dd>

    <dt>How do I set a theme?</dt>
    <dd>Type <tt>/theme</tt> followed by the theme.  For example, to set the theme to "rainbows", you would type <tt>/theme rainbows</tt></dd>

    <dt>How do I unset a theme?</dt>
    <dd>Use <tt>/theme</tt> on it's own.  The theme will also reset itself automatically after approximately ten minutes of nothing in the queue.</dd>

    <dt>Why won't the songs play on my iOS device?</dt>
    <dd>Apple has decided you would need to interact with every song (click a button, essentially), which makes it rather impractical for the both of us.</dd>
 
    <dt>What is this MeFi Music Bot and why can't I see them in my chat status?</dt>
    <dd>It's a bot (obviously) that will add music to the queue when members are around but not adding anything to the queue.  The bot doesn't interact with members so there's no need for them to show up in chat.  When someone other than the bot adds music to the queue, it'll pause and let the members play for awhile.</dd>

    <dt>The bot picked a horrible song!</dt>
    <dd>That's not really a question, now is it?  It's a random song.  You can remove it &mdash; the bot won't have hard feelings.</dd>

    <dt>This is seriously awesome, but so distracting&hellip;</dt>
    <dd>Yes, it can be.  You can minimize each (or all) of the windows by clicking on the titles, which may help you focus on work and not this website.</dd>

    <dt>I have a pony request!  Can you &hellip;?</dt>
    <dd>Sure, just MeMail me.  If don't know what that means, how do you know what a pony request is?</dd>

    <dt>This is all swell, but how does it work?</dt>
    <dd>Just like magnets.</dd>

    <dt>Seriously?  How does it work?</dt>
    <dd>You can see the source code at my github page.</dd>
